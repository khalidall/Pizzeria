              science and then i was waiting for a good school in the coronca
              year(i mean lately every year is coronas year don't you think,
              anyway 2020), but as you may know deseases brings chaos and the
              chaos brings self interest, anyway boring details, then i went to
              economics sciences university for one year, And now here i am now

            I love coding. Ever since I bought my first computer, I've been
            fascinated by computer programming. For many years I never thought
            of why I enjoyed it so much .I just knew I did.

            I've spent a little bit of time learning skate and it was a fun
            experience if it's not school and if i haven't lost my skateboard
            i'd skate everyday.It is a very fun sport if you have dedicaction.

            I like listening to music because it can be interpreted in so many

            youtube sad song and a million would come up. just depends on my
            mood.
